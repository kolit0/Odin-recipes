  <h1>Chicken Shawarma :DD</h1>
  <h3>Description:</h3>
  <p>Originating in Turkey ("shawarma" roughly means "turning," which makes good sense), shawarma is primarily a street food, specifically lamb or mutton meat skewered and slow-roasted rotisserie-style with layers of lamb fat and a blend of smoky, fruity, and peppery spices.</p>
  <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1 chicken breast</li>
    <li>200 grams of Romaine Lettuce</li>
    <li>100 grams of Coriander</li>
    <li>3 tomatoes</li>
    <li>1 onion</li>
    <li>2 garlic cloves</li>
    <li>1 curry spoon</li>
    <li>½ spoon of cumin</li>
    <li>5 milliliters of lemon juice</li>
    <li>pita bread</li>
    <li>tahini sauce</li>
    <li>Olive oil</li>
    <li>1 pinch of salt</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Steps:</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Thinly slice the tomatoes, romaine lettuce and onion. Also finely chop the garlic and parsley.</li>
    <li>Cut the chicken breast into strips.</li>
    <li>Add the chicken in a bowl, with the juice of ½ lemon, 1 tablespoon of curry, 2 tablespoons of olive oil, ½ tablespoon of cumin, and garlic. Remove and let rest for 30 minutes.</li>
    <li>Subsequently cook the seasoned chicken on a grill or griddle until browned on both sides.</li>
    <li>Pass the pita breads through the grill only until warm and brown the bread a little.</li>
    <li>On each bun, add the seasoned chicken filling, and place romaine lettuce, tomatoes and onion strips. Also place tahini sauce to taste. Roll up and serve.</li>
  </ol>
